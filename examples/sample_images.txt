# Sample Images for Testing

To test the image classification example, you'll need some sample images. Here are a few ways to get sample images:

1. **Use your own images**: You can use any image file from your computer.

2. **Download sample images**: You can download sample images from various sources, such as:
   - [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) - Free high-resolution photos
   - [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) - Free stock photos
   - [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) - Free stock photos and videos

3. **Use sample images from datasets**: You can use sample images from datasets like:
   - [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
   - [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/)
   - [COCO](https://cocodataset.org/)

## Example Usage

Once you have a sample image, you can run the image classification example like this:

```bash
python image_classification.py path/to/your/image.jpg
```

The script will classify the image into one of the predefined categories and display the results.
